                    <p>Dr. Kale is currently Research Professor & Paul and Cynthia Saylor Professor Emeritus in the
                        Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois. As the director of the Parallel
                        Programming
                        Laboratory, he led the development of a number of languages and systems for parallel
                        programming, most notably the Charm++ system for adaptive task based programming. Charm++
                        enabled the development
                        of highly scalable parallel applications, such as the NAMD molecular dynamics framework. As of
                        2024, his work has been cited over 42,000 times with an h-index of 69. Dr. Kale has also been
                        recognized
                        as a fellow of the ACM, a fellow of the IEEE, and received the Gordon Bell prize in 2002 and the
                        Sidney Fernbach award in 2012.
