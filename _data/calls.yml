  The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for
  presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high-end
  computing. The 33rd HPDC will take place in Pisa, Italy, June 3-7, 2024.

scope: >
  Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing (HPDC) topics including but not limited to: clouds,
  clusters, grids, big data, massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Experience reports of operational deployments
  that provide significantly novel insights for future research on HPDC applications and systems are also welcome.
