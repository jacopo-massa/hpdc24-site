  The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for
  presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high-end
  computing. The 33rd HPDC will take place in Pisa, Italy, June 3-7, 2024.


scope: >
  Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing (HPDC) topics including but not limited to: clouds,
  clusters, grids, big data, massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Experience reports of operational deployments
  that provide significantly novel insights for future research on HPDC applications and systems are also welcome.

topics:
- Datacenter, HPC, cloud, serverless, and edge/IoT computing platforms
- Heterogeneous computing accelerators and non-volatile memory systems
- File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
- Operating systems and networks 
- System software and middleware for parallel and distributed systems
- Programming languages and runtime systems
- Big data stacks and big data ecosystems
- Scientific applications, algorithms, and workflows
- Resource management and scheduling
- Performance modeling, benchmarking, and engineering
- Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability
- Operational guarantees, risk assessment, and management
- Novel post-Moore computing technologies including neuromorphic, brain-inspired computing, and quantum computing
