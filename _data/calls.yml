description: >
  The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance, Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for 
  presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high-performance 
  computing.


scope: >
  Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing topics including but not limited to: clouds, clusters, 
  grids, big data, massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Submissions presenting new open-source tools or data are 
  encouraged. Experience reports of operational deployments that present novel insights for future research on HPDC applications and systems 
  are also welcome. In the context of high-performance parallel and distributed computing, the topics of interest include, but are not 
  limited to:

  This call for posters welcomes contribution of accompanying papers of two (2) ACM-formatted double-column pages short papers for the 
  main HPDC conferences. Authors are invited to submit a short two-page writeup covering original work-in-progress (WIP) or ongoing research 
  suitable for presentation at the conference venue in poster form. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:


topics:
- Datacenter, HPC, cloud, serverless, and edge/IoT computing platforms
- Heterogeneous computing accelerators and non-volatile memory systems
- File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
- Operating systems and networks
- System software and middleware for parallel and distributed systems
- Programming languages and runtime systems
- Big data stacks and big data ecosystems
- Scientific applications, algorithms, and workflows
- Resource management and scheduling
- Performance modeling, benchmarking, and engineering
- Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability
- Operational guarantees, risk assessment, and management
- Novel post-Moore computing technologies including neuromorphic, brain-inspired computing, and quantum computing.
