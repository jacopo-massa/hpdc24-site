      Migratable Objects programming model and its embodiment in systems such as Charm++, Adaptive MPI, and Charm4Py, has led to development of some highly scalable, and highly adaptive,  parallel applications. We trace the beginnings of its conception in the needs of combinatorial search and logic programming applications in the early days of parallel computing. This led to concepts of message-driven execution (aka task-based models), chares (message-driven objects or a form of  Actors)  and migratable task-seeds. When we started addressing science and engineering applications, with their iterative structure and spatial decompositions, the Charm++ model evolved to incorporate indexed collections of Chares, and asynchronous collective communication structures over them. The persistence or predictability of load and communication patterns in such applications gave rise to dynamic load balancing capabilities by allowing the chare objects to migrate across nodes, and associated distributed location management. Advent of large multi-core nodes as well as GPGPUs didn’t change the fundamental structure of these programming models, but required simple adoption of new within-node task-handling capabilities.

      I will review the successes and failures of this model, and reflect on where it stands today. I also look at other current systems that incorporate some of the ideas from this programming model, either by independent discovery, or partially derived from Charm++. Along the way, I will posit some reflections on what makes research ideas succeed or fail, in a field such as parallel programming, which is influenced by subjective preferences and perceived advantages.

      Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) specifically, have recently been used to model source code, which has proven to be effective for a variety of software development tasks such as code completion, summarization, translation, and debugging, among others. While the programming languages and software engineering (PL/SE) communities are abuzz with AI-based tools for code development (AIforDev), the application of AIforDev to parallel code has been largely unexplored. Writing, debugging and optimizing parallel code is hard, and the question before the HPC community is -- do AI and LLMs hold the potential for revolutionizing parallel software development. In this talk, I will address the shortcomings of current LLMs when used for parallel code development and how we can close the gap toward building HPC-capable LLMs.  I will further highlight emerging areas of research such as improving code modeling capabilities to facilitate various aspects of parallel code development, such as generating correct and efficient parallel code, reasoning about parallel performance, and much more.

  - title: "Resource Consumption & Service Demand Forecasting"
    speaker: "Theodora Varvarigou"
    role: "Professor"
    affiliation: "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)"
    abstract: This presentation is dedicated to exploring various contemporary Resource Consumption & Service Demand Forecasting methodologies. These methodologies include a plethora of state-of-the-art Deep Learning solutions, such as Encoder-Decoder topologies, and Graph Neural Networks. The efficiency of the explored solutions is examined on the basis of two different aspects. The first one is the ability of the various forecasting models to provide accurate Resource Consumption & Service Demand predictions. The second one is the impact of leveraging these predictions on intelligent resource allocation processes, such as Horizontal Autoscaling.
