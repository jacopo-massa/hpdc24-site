      "Migratable Objects programming model and its embodiment in systems such as Charm++, Adaptive MPI, and Charm4Py, has led to development of some highly scalable, and highly adaptive,  parallel applications. We trace the beginnings of its conception in the needs of combinatorial search and logic programming applications in the early days of parallel computing. This led to concepts of message-driven execution (aka task-based models), chares (message-driven objects or a form of  Actors)  and migratable task-seeds. When we started addressing science and engineering applications, with their iterative structure and spatial decompositions, the Charm++ model evolved to incorporate indexed collections of Chares, and asynchronous collective communication structures over them. The persistence or predictability of load and communication patterns in such applications gave rise to dynamic load balancing capabilities by allowing the chare objects to migrate across nodes, and associated distributed location management. Advent of large multi-core nodes as well as GPGPUs didnâ€™t change the fundamental structure of these programming models, but required simple adoption of new within-node task-handling capabilities.

      I will review the successes and failures of this model, and reflect on where it stands today. I also look at other current systems that incorporate some of the ideas from this programming model, either by independent discovery, or partially derived from Charm++. Along the way, I will posit some reflections on what makes research ideas succeed or fail, in a field such as parallel programming, which is influenced by subjective preferences and perceived advantages."

      "Professor Laxmikant Kale is the director of the Parallel Programming Laboratory and Research Professor, as well as the Paul and Cynthia Saylor Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Prof. Kale has been working on various aspects of parallel computing, with a focus on enhancing performance and productivity via adaptive runtime systems, and with the belief that only interdisciplinary research involving multiple CSE and other applications can bring back well-honed abstractions into Computer Science that will have a long-term impact on the state-of-art.
      His collaborations include the widely used Gordon-Bell award winning (SC 2002) biomolecular simulation program NAMD, and other collaborations on computational cosmology, quantum chemistry, rocket simulation, space-time meshes, and other unstructured mesh applications. He takes pride in his group's success in distributing and supporting software embodying his research ideas, including Charm++, Adaptive MPI and Charm4Py. He and his team won the HPC Challenge award at Supercomputing 2011, for their entry based on Charm++. Prof. Kale is a fellow of the ACM and IEEE, and a winner of the 2012 IEEE Sidney Fernbach award."
