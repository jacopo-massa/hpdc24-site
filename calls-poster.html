        <h6 id="categories">Paper Submission Categories</h6>
        <p> Submissions can be made in one of the following two categories: (1) regular papers, or (2) open-source tools
            or data papers.
            The primary focus of "regular papers" should be to describe new research ideas supported by experimental
            implementation and
            evaluation of the proposed research ideas. The primary focus of "open-source tools or data" should be to
            describe the design,
            development, and evaluation of new open-source tools or novel data sources/products. Submissions in the
            "regular papers" category
            are also encouraged to open-source their software, data, and hardware artifacts.

            <br><br>

            Authors are required to indicate the category
            of the paper as a part of the submitted manuscript's title. The last line of the title should indicate the
            paper type by using
            one of the two phrases (1) Paper Type: Regular, or (2) Paper Type: Open-source tools or data.

            <br><br>

            All submissions in the open-source
            tools or data category may use the maximum allowed number of pages, as is the case with regular papers.
            However, papers in the
            open-source tools or data papers category of shorter length are welcome, if the contributions can be well
            articulated and
            substantiated.

            <br><br>

            Submissions in both categories will be evaluated to the same standards in terms of novelty, scientific
            value,
            demonstrated usefulness, and potential impact on the field. The nature of the contribution differs between
            the two categories
            (new research idea vs. new open-source tool or data) and papers will be evaluated based on the intended
            nature of the contribution,
            as declared by the chosen paper category at the time of the submission. The chosen category at the time of
            the submission can not
            be changed after the submission deadline.

        <h6 id="guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h6>
        <p>
            Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most 11 double column pages in PDF format, excluding
            references.
            Accepted papers will have the flexibility to use an additional page in the camera-ready version to
            incorporate feedback from the
            reviewers.

            Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style and submitted via the HotCRP submission website.
            Papers should use the
            double column format (in Latex this can be done by using the "sigconf" class as follows:

        <pre>   \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}</pre>
        Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another
        conference or journal.
        The author list must be removed for double-blind review.

        We recognize that time-constrained rebuttal periods can be challenging for some members of our HPDC
        community. Also, uniformly
        ensuring high quality of the rebuttal component for all papers is difficult due to time constraints.
        Therefore, there will be NO
        rebuttal or revision phase, which will shorten the review period and provide feedback to authors quickly.

        To promote fair and equitable reviewing, HPDC will use a double-blind review process. Please refer to
        “Anonymizing Submissions”
        for detailed guidelines. Research has shown that single-blind reviewing can disadvantage authors from
        under-represented groups.
        Guidance for anonymizing submissions is described below.

        You are requested to submit your research paper using the {{site.data.submission.portal}}:
        <a href="{{site.data.submission.url}}">{{site.data.submission.url}}</a>.

        The submissions must conform to the <a href="{{site.data.cfp.submission}}">Submission Guidelines</a>,
        and must not exceed {{site.data.submission.pagelimit}} pages including text, figures and references.
        The submissions should include the title, abstract, and names and affiliations of all authors.

        <h6 id="intro">Suggested format for Introduction section</h6>
        <p>
            Authors are encouraged (but not required) to structure their introduction section of the paper in the
            following format
            (as subsections or headings). The suggested length is a maximum of two pages for this format.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Motivation.</strong> Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide (quantitative) support to
            motivate the specific
            problem the paper aims to address. <br>

            <strong>Limitation of state-of-art approaches.</strong> Briefly review the most relevant and most recent
            prior work. Clearly
            articulate the limitations of prior work and how your approach addresses those limitations. A more detailed
            discussion should
            be reserved for the related work section. But, this section should be sufficient to help readers recognize
            the novelty of your
            approach. <br>

            <strong>Key insights and contributions.</strong> Briefly articulate the major insights that enable your
            approach or make it
            effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance the state-of-the-art. Describe
            the key ideas of
            your approach and design. List the key contributions including empirical results and improvement over prior
            work as applicable.<br>

            <strong>Limitations of the proposed approach.</strong> Almost all scientific contributions have limitations
            and scope for
            improvement. Clearly articulate the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that
            are sensitive to
            pecific assumptions made in the paper. Please note this suggested format is not a requirement for submission
            and authors have
            the flexibility to choose how they articulate their contributions. We hope that this structured format
            achieves two purposes:
            (1) helps authors state their contributions clearly and concisely, and (2) allows reviewers to judge the
            contributions more
            objectively. Authors will not be penalized for not following this format.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h6 id="anonymization">Anonymizing Submissions</h6>
        <p>
            HPDC will continue to use a double-blind review process. Please make a good-faith attempt to anonymize your
            submission.
            Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or
            acknowledgments).
            The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. Use care
            in referring to your
            own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers
            to place your
            submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your prior work in the third person, just as you would
            any other piece of
            related work. In some cases, it is not credible to refer to your related work in the third person. For
            example, your submission
            may extend a previous workshop paper or relate to a submission currently under review at HPDC or another
            venue. In these cases,
            you must still explain the differences between your HPDC submission and the other work, but you should cite
            the other work
            anonymously and e-mail the deanonymized work to the PC chairs. If your submission reports on experiences
            with a system at your
            institution, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are
            needed to evaluate
            the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests). We recognize that, in some cases, these
            properties may allow a
            reviewer to identify your institution. All open-source tools or data papers should also adhere to the
            double-blind submission
            policy. If the described tool/dataset is already widely used by the research community, consider describing
            the framework using
            a different name and not sharing the open-source code repository in the paper.

        <h6 id="confidentiality">Confidential Information</h6>
        <p> Papers containing information that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will not be considered for
            review.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h6 id="arxiv">arXiv Submission Policy</h6>
        <p> A prior version of a paper shared on arXiv does not prohibit authors from submitting to HPDC 2023. arXiv
            papers are not
            peer-reviewed and are not considered as formal publications. Authors are not expected to compare against
            arXiv papers that have
            not been published in conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please
            continue to follow the
            double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances
            of accidental breach
            of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission). Authors should not upload or revise an arXiv
            version of an HPDC
            submission during the review period (from the submission deadline until author notification).
        </p>

        <h6 id="authlist">Author List After Acceptance</h6>
        <p> The author list cannot be changed after acceptance. </p>

        <br>
        <h6 id="conflicts">Conflict of Interest Declaratione</h6>
        <p> At the time of submission, all authors must indicate their conflict of interest with the PC members. A
            conflict of interest may
            be institutional, collaborative, or personal. Please see detailed guidelines about how to accurately declare
            a conflict of
            interest on the submission website. </p>

        <br>
        <h6 id="ethical">Ethical Guidelines</h6>
        <p> If your research describes a new security-related attack, please consider adding information about
            responsible disclosure.
            Overall, as appropriate and relevant, the paper should follow ethical principles and not alter the
            security/privacy/equality
            expectations of the associated human users. </p>

        <br>
        <h6 id="inclusivity">Inclusivity</h6>
        <p> HPDC is committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Staying at the forefront of high
            performance and distributed
            computing requires the contributions and perspectives of people with diverse backgrounds. The conference
            aims to foster an
            inclusive environment that values the contributions of the entire community regardless of race, gender, age,
            sexual orientation,
            disability, physical appearance, religion, academic affiliation, or seniority. </p>

        <p> We ask that authors make their research contribution inclusive in nature. For example, consider using
            gender-neutral pronouns,
            using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, and engaging users from diverse backgrounds if the research
            is qualitative.
            Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers. </p>

        <p> All attendees are expected to abide by the HPDC Code of Conduct. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your
                co-authors are subject to
                all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human
                Participants and Subjects.
                Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may
                result in a full
                retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
            </li>
            <li> Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing
                process for your accepted
                paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect
                ORCID IDs from all of
                our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout
                2022. We are committed
                to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts
                around name
                normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.</li>
