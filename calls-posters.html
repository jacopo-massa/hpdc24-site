        <h6 id="submission">Poster Submission Guidelines</h6>
        <p> We invite authors to submit poster contributions in the form of a three-page extended abstract and a poster draft.
        	Abstracts shall be submitted via the poster submission website and should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style
        	(for Latex, use \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}, for MS Word  use the template provided by ACM here https://tinyurl.com/bde976ds ).
        	We recommend A1 size for the poster, portrait orientation.

			Each submission should include a title, all author names and affiliations, notes on whether any of the authors are students,
			and an indication of which author is corresponding/presenting the material. 
			Poster abstracts will be reviewed by the poster program committee through a single-blind process and will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
			<ol>
				<li>Submissions must describe new and interesting ideas related to HPDC topics of interest.</li>
				<li>Submissions can present work in progress, but authors are strongly encouraged to include preliminary experimental results, if available.</li>
				<li>Student submissions meeting the above criteria will be given preference.</li>
			</ol>
        </p>
